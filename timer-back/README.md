# Pento tech challenge

Thanks for taking the time to do our tech challenge. 

The challenge is to build a small full stack web app, that can help a freelancer track their time.

It should satisfy these user stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to start a time tracking session
- As a user, I want to be able to stop a time tracking session
- As a user, I want to be able to name my time tracking session
- As a user, I want to be able to save my time tracking session when I am done with it
- As a user, I want an overview of my sessions for the day, week and month
- As a user, I want to be able to close my browser and shut down my computer and still have my sessions visible to me when I power it up again.

## Getting started

You can fork this repo and use the fork as a basis for your project. We don't have any requirements on what stack you use to solve the task, so there is nothing set up beforehand.

## Timing

- Don't spend more than a days work on this challenge. We're not looking for perfection, rather try to show us something special and have reasons for your decisions.
- Get back to us when you have a timeline for when you are done.

## Notes

 - This is technically possible to implement only on the frontend, but please take the opportunity to show your skills on the entire stack 
 - Please focus more on code quality, building a robust service and such, than on the UI.
